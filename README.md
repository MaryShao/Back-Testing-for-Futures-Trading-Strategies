# Back-Testing-for-Futures-Trading-Strategies
Scenario Test, Portfolio Management (Markowitz, GMVP, risk-parity), Self-rebalancing Models

This is an intern project I did at Guoyuan Securities Company Limited for futures trading strategies.

1. Back-testing: 
   Conducted scenario and performance factor test for trading strategies, and utilized cluster, 
   similarity, and dimension reduction analysis for the ranking process in portfolio management 
   models (GMVP, Markowitz, risk-parity, etc.) to figure out optimal position allocation.  
   
2. Self-rebalancing: 
   Presented a dynamic portfolio rebalancing model through a moving window out-of-sample tests. 
   
3. Trading Strategies: 
   Developed futures strategies based on time series, regression, and machine learning models.
